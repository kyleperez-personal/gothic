Things left to do with nouns:

Need to put in devoicing rule
(IE: b -> f, d -> Ã¾, z -> s when those 3 characters are the last ones, or when followed by an 's').

Put in special noun cases:
'manna' (man)
irregular nouns that are mostly regular (need way to override default declensions)
personal pronouns (including reflexivity)
hwas / hwis / hwo (interoggative pronouns)

Then move onto other grammatical stuff
