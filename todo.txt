Things left to do with nouns:

How to handle the special noun 'sunno', which uses 3 genders depending on case.
Not sure how to deal with.

Verbs:
Need to consider cases where present conjugations use a different infinitive than preterite
Ideally without just using overrides for everything, since that's cheap
Need to put in infrastructure to override stuff as well. See adjectives/nouns.
Then present-preterite ones
The copula
Other irregular verbs (itan, etc)
Putting in perfective forms

Adjective / Adverb formation
Or noun formation from adjectives
Will get to later.
