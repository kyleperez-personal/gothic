Things left to do with nouns:

Need to put in devoicing rule
(IE: b -> f, d -> Ã¾, z -> s when those 3 characters are the last ones, or when followed by an 's').

Need to put in j stem nouns
(IE: fairguni is SN nom, with plural fairgunja)
(IE: gawi is SN nom, with plural gauja)
(IE: sunja is normal)
(IE: mawi is SF nom, but mauja is SF acc)

Then move onto other grammatical stuff
