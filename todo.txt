Things left to do with nouns:

How to handle the special noun 'sunno', which uses 3 genders depending on case.
Not sure how to deal with.

Verbs:
Put in Class 7 Strong Verbs (2 types which don't have a clean classification)
Need to consider cases where present conjugations use a different infinitive than preterite
Then present-preterite ones
The copula
Other irregular verbs (itan, etc)
Putting in perfective forms

Adjective / Adverb formation
Or noun formation from adjectives
Will get to later.
